Emotional Intelligence

00:00:03.642 --> 00:00:06.093
This course is made up of the following modules:

00:00:06.275 --> 00:00:08.540
Understanding Emotional Intelligence

00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:10.960
Self-Awareness and Emotional Triggers

00:00:11.175 --> 00:00:14.601
And Lastly, Using Emotional Intelligence in Real Life.

00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:25.396
Welcome! Let’s Talk About Emotions. We all have emotions, and they affect

00:00:25.546 --> 00:00:28.635
how we speak, listen, lead, and respond to life.

00:00:29.108 --> 00:00:33.405
Emotional intelligence helps us understand those feelings, whether it’s joy,

00:00:33.555 --> 00:00:37.445
frustration, or nervous excitement, and handle them with more intention.

00:00:37.595 --> 00:00:41.961
This course will help you know yourself better, manage emotional highs and

00:00:42.111 --> 00:00:45.398
lows, and connect more deeply with people around you.

00:00:45.642 --> 00:00:49.497
It’s not about suppressing emotion. It’s about recognising it, working with

00:00:49.647 --> 00:00:53.375
it, and using it wisely. And to bring this to life, we’ll follow someone

00:00:53.525 --> 00:00:54.501
relatable!

00:00:59.775 --> 00:01:04.641
Meet David. He just started a new job, and he’s full of energy and big ideas.

00:01:04.842 --> 00:01:09.940
He’s smart, enthusiastic, and eager to succeed. But sometimes, his emotions

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.967
get ahead of him. When he’s excited, he jumps into conversations too quickly.

00:01:15.117 --> 00:01:19.669
When he’s praised or happy, he says yes to everything and ends up overwhelmed.

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:24.278
And in moments of tension, he finds it hard to read the room or respond

00:01:24.428 --> 00:01:25.126
calmly.

00:01:25.608 --> 00:01:29.789
Throughout this course, we’ll follow David’s journey, not to point out what’s

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.398
wrong, but to see how emotional intelligence helps him navigate both the

00:01:34.548 --> 00:01:38.775
positive and the negative sides of his daily life. But let’s start with

00:01:38.925 --> 00:01:39.344
you!

00:01:44.608 --> 00:01:49.334
Let's proceed to Module One: Understanding Emotional Intelligence.
By the

00:01:49.484 --> 00:01:51.981
end of this module, you’ll be able to:

00:01:52.142 --> 00:01:54.221
Define emotional intelligence

00:01:54.442 --> 00:01:56.289
Distinguish EI from IQ

00:01:56.508 --> 00:02:00.294
Understand the five components of Emotional Intelligence based on Daniel

00:02:00.444 --> 00:02:01.699
Goleman’s model

00:02:01.908 --> 00:02:07.052
And, Recognise how emotional intelligence shows up in everyday life.

00:02:12.308 --> 00:02:15.037
Do You Ever Feel Like Your Emotions Are Running the Show?

00:02:15.542 --> 00:02:19.734
Have you ever gotten carried away in a moment, said something you regret,

00:02:19.884 --> 00:02:22.822
or felt so excited you made a hasty decision?

00:02:38.142 --> 00:02:40.035
What Is Emotional Intelligence?

00:02:40.908 --> 00:02:45.657
According to psychologist Daniel Goleman, emotional intelligence is the ability

00:02:45.807 --> 00:02:50.209
to recognize, understand, and manage your own emotions, while also responding

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:52.229
well to the emotions of others.

00:02:52.675 --> 00:02:59.003
It's helps you stay grounded in moments of pressure, joy, anxiety, or excitement.

00:02:59.153 --> 00:03:03.984
It’s about being intentional, not impulsive, with what you feel and how

00:03:04.134 --> 00:03:08.686
you act.
Most people are not familiar with emotional intelligence; they

00:03:08.836 --> 00:03:12.715
are only familiar with IQ. Both of these are different and very important.

00:03:12.865 --> 00:03:14.259
let’s compare them.

00:03:19.508 --> 00:03:23.723
Emotional Intelligence which is known as EI, vs Intelligence Quotient, which

00:03:23.873 --> 00:03:25.117
is known as IQ.

00:03:25.308 --> 00:03:30.742
IQ measures thinking and logic. It helps with test scores, technical skills,

00:03:30.892 --> 00:03:32.310
and solving problems.

00:03:32.842 --> 00:03:37.638
EI deals with self-awareness, emotion, and connection with others.
IQ might

00:03:37.788 --> 00:03:42.351
help you get a job. EI helps you keep it and thrive while working with people.

00:03:42.501 --> 00:03:46.856
It’s easy to think intelligence is the only thing that matters. However,

00:03:47.006 --> 00:03:51.047
being emotionally intelligent can also help you become emotionally aware

00:03:51.197 --> 00:03:55.378
and connect with your surroundings. These are part of the reason EI matters

00:03:55.528 --> 00:03:56.423
most times.

00:04:03.375 --> 00:04:05.129
Why It Matters in Real Life!

00:04:06.642 --> 00:04:11.438
It helps you manage frustration, but also excitement, enthusiasm, and joy.

00:04:11.588 --> 00:04:16.987
Without it, emotions can drive overreactions, impulsive decisions, or emotional

00:04:17.137 --> 00:04:21.376
crashes. With it, you enjoy the highs, handle the lows, and stay steady

00:04:21.526 --> 00:04:25.846
when it matters most. So, how do you spot emotional intelligence in action?

00:04:25.996 --> 00:04:27.994
Let’s look at five key skills.

00:04:33.275 --> 00:04:35.819
The Building Blocks of Emotional Intelligence.

00:04:36.508 --> 00:04:41.397
According to Daniel Goleman, emotional intelligence includes five core skills.

00:04:41.547 --> 00:04:44.531
Let’s explore each one with a real-life example.

00:04:44.742 --> 00:04:50.060
Self-Awareness: You realise you’re dominating a conversation and shift the

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.600
spotlight to others.
That’s self-awareness—knowing what you feel and how

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.295
it might affect others.

00:04:56.475 --> 00:05:00.888
Self-Regulation: You feel irritated but pause before reacting and say, 'Let’s

00:05:01.038 --> 00:05:05.613
figure this out.'
That’s self-regulation—managing how you express emotion.

00:05:06.008 --> 00:05:09.863
Motivation: You’re working toward a tough goal, and even when things get

00:05:10.013 --> 00:05:13.939
frustrating, you stay focused because it matters to you. That’s motivation,

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:16.446
using emotion to fuel progress.

00:05:16.642 --> 00:05:21.310
Empathy: You notice a friend is quiet and ask, 'Want to talk?'
That’s empathy,

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.969
tuning in to how others might feel.

00:05:24.175 --> 00:05:29.993
Social Skills: During a team meeting, you help smooth over a tense moment

00:05:30.143 --> 00:05:34.567
by encouraging collaboration and making sure everyone is heard.
That’s

00:05:34.717 --> 00:05:40.290
social skill, navigating relationships and guiding group dynamics.
Emotional

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.377
intelligence isn’t about one big moment, it’s about the small, everyday

00:05:44.527 --> 00:05:49.427
choices you make. It shows up in how you respond to praise, handle pressure,

00:05:49.577 --> 00:05:53.421
and treat people when no one’s looking. Let’s see how well you can spot

00:05:53.571 --> 00:05:54.489
it in action.

00:05:59.775 --> 00:06:03.851
Try again!!!. The more you practice, the stronger your skills become

00:06:05.275 --> 00:06:09.885
Now, go back to David. We'll be using him as an example here. What did he

00:06:10.035 --> 00:06:10.651
miss?

00:06:10.842 --> 00:06:15.382
He was excited about his idea, but jumped in too soon and interrupted a teammate

00:06:15.532 --> 00:06:19.597
without realisingg it.
He wasn’t trying to be rude, he just didn’t notice

00:06:19.747 --> 00:06:22.395
how his emotions were showing up in that moment.

00:06:22.608 --> 00:06:25.012
What would have helped David in this moment?

00:06:30.108 --> 00:06:34.741
You’ve just explored the foundation of emotional intelligence. You’ve Learned!

00:06:34.942 --> 00:06:36.882

00:06:37.075 --> 00:06:38.829
How it differs from IQ

00:06:39.042 --> 00:06:44.047
And the five key skills that help you grow. Next, we’ll zoom in on Self-Awareness,

00:06:44.197 --> 00:06:48.459
and how it helps you better understand and manage your emotional patterns!
